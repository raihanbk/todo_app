# todo_withapi

A new Flutter project.

The Todo App is a simple mobile application built using the Flutter framework for the frontend and an API as the backend. The app allows users to manage their tasks with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Each task consists of a title and a description.

Key Features:
1. Task Management: Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks.
2. Title and Description: Each task has a title field for a brief summary and a description        field for additional details.
3. API Backend: The app interacts with a remote API backend to store and retrieve task data.       This allows for data persistence and synchronization across multiple devices.
4. User Interface: The app features a clean and intuitive user interface with a list view to       display tasks and options to add, edit, and delete tasks.
5. Theme Support: The app supports light and dark themes, providing users with a customizable      visual experience.
